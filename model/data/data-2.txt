NASA´s Perseverance rover landed on Mars on February 18, 2021. It carried a helicopter that was at the bottom of the rover. A special metal cover kept the helicopter safe during the landing.

Currently, the rover is on its way to a place where the helicopter will try to fly for the first time. Nothing that people ever made has flown on another planet before.

It was not easy to make an aircraft that could fly on Mars. Mars has different gravity and atmosphere, too. It means that the helicopter must be very small and light. Also, it gets very cold on Mars at night, and both the rover and the helicopter must have special heating. It protects electrical parts from freezing and breaking.

On April 8, the helicopter will make the first attempt to fly. If it is successful, it can change the way that people explore Mars.

On April 8, 2021, NASA is targeting for the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter to make the first attempt at a powered, controlled flight of an aircraft on another planet.

Ingenuity remains attached to the belly of NASA´s Perseverance rover that touched down on Mars on February 18. On March 21, the rover deployed a shield that protected Ingenuity during landing. Currently, the rover is in transit to the place where Ingenuity will attempt to fly.

However, flying in a controlled manner on Mars is far more difficult than flying on Earth because Mars has about one-third of Earth´s gravity, and its atmosphere is 1% as dense as Earth´s at the surface. During Martian daytime, the planet receives only about half the amount of solar energy that reaches Earth during its daytime, and nighttime temperatures can drop as low as minus 90 degrees Celsius, which can freeze and crack unprotected electrical components.

If successful, Ingenuity could expand the horizons and broaden the scope of what is possible with Mars exploration.

A streak of light in the night sky over much of the Portland area of Oregon, US, spurred speculation among people. However, the mysterious bright lights weren´t planes or meteors, but they turned out to be debris from a SpaceX rocket.

The rocket was launched in Florida on March 4, and it was one of four SpaceX rockets launched in the last month. However, the rocket failed to perform a deorbit, and it reentered the Earth´s atmosphere at the wrong angle, causing it to burn up and scatter debris across the sky. Weather service officials said that they hadn´t heard of any impacts across the region, and they weren´t sure if some debris fell to the ground.

SpaceX launches happen regularly in California, Texas, and Florida, and for some Americans, it is a common thing to see unidentified rockets, or their debris, whizzing overhead; however, in the Seattle and Portland areas, the spectacle caused delight and bewilderment.

More countries in the world are starting to vaccinate people against COVID-19, and some people would like to make vaccine passports.

These passports would show that a person got the COVID-19 vaccine and that he could not spread the virus so easily.

Many countries which depend on tourists are excited, and they would like to introduce vaccine passports. For businesses which suffered during the pandemic, a vaccine passport could be a big help.

The problem is that tests showed that none of the COVID-19 vaccines was 100% effective. This means that some people who get the vaccine could still spread the virus. Another problem is that some countries started to vaccinate people months ago, but some countries are just starting. Also, older people got the vaccine earlier than younger people. Some people say that it is not fair that older people could travel because they would have the vaccine passport, but younger people could not.

The discussion of COVID-19 vaccine passports has risen as more of the world gets vaccinated. Vaccine passports are certificates or digital cards testifying to the apparent low-risk status to their holders.

Greece is the most noticeable country in an effort to revive travel with the help of so-called vaccine passports that are gaining traction in tourist-reliant economies from the Caribbean to Thailand. Businesses that have suffered a yearlong battering from the pandemic are also coming as a route to salvation. Airlines have supported a number of tech solutions to verify passengers´ Covid vaccination or test results.

However, none of the available shots is 100% effective which means that travelers with vaccine passports could possibly continue to spread the virus in crowded resorts. Questions are also surrounding the fairness of vaccine passports, which would favor richer nations over poorer ones where vaccination has only just begun. Also, the passports would open up travel to the elderly and middle-aged who have been prioritized for vaccination.

Japanese researchers have discovered a sea slug that can self-decapitate and regrow a whole new body in a matter of weeks.

The discovery was made by chance when scientists noticed that three of the 82 Elysia slugs decapitated their bodies at the neck and two of them regenerated their bodies within a week. It was a survival method meant to get rid of parasites living inside the bodies.

It´s not clear how the slugs can live without some of their vital organs; however, they can live without a heart probably because their heads are small, and they can intake oxygen from their body´s surface.

A scientist observed one of the slugs whose heart and body regenerated from the tip of its head, which could indicate that there were stem cells in this area. If the research of these stem cells continues, it could lead to advances in regenerative medicine.

In December, a Spanish ship took 855 cows on board at the Spanish port of Cartagena. The ship traveled to Turkey but it did not get there.

The reason was a mistake in documents and Turkey rejected the animals. Turkey thought that the cattle had bluetongue virus.

Other countries rejected the animals, too, so the ship stayed at sea for two months. The journey was too long for the animals, they started to have many health problems, and then some of them died.

Spanish veterinarians checked the animals and they saw the bad situation on the ship. They decided that it would be better to kill the animals and end their pain.

More than 854 cattle have spent two months adrift in the Mediterranean after being rejected by several countries.

The reason why the animals were stranded at sea were fears that they had bovine bluetongue virus. The vessel is owned and managed by two Lebanese companies while the cattle are owned by a third party. The ship took the male calves, who were about seven to eight months old, on board at the Spanish port of Cartagena in mid-December, and the ship sailed for Turkey. However, a mistake on the Spanish government´s animal health paperwork led Turkey to reject the cattle, fearing that they could be infected with bluetongue.

According to a report by Spanish government veterinarians, the animals were no longer fit for transport and they should be killed. The animals have been kept in very poor conditions and they have suffered from the lengthy journey. The report concluded that euthanasia would be the best solution for the animals´ health and welfare.

In February, cold winds brought very low temperatures to North America. The Niagara Falls, which are one of the best tourist attractions in the US, froze.

The falls did not freeze completely, but they looked so. Thick ice made a crust on the falls, but the water was still flowing under the ice. The falls cannot freeze because there is too much water in them, and the water is very strong. It can never stop flowing.

The water stopped flowing only once in history. It happened when ice from Lake Eerie blocked the flow, so only little water was flowing in the falls. It cannot happen again because there is a special construction on the river which stops the ice.

Hard Article:
As temperatures plunged across North America in February, the Niagara Falls partially froze on both sides of the US-Canada border.

Thick ice formations coated the iconic waterfall; however, the amount of ice didn´t stop the water from flowing completely. The volume and force of the water is too great to ever freeze solid, even at extremely low temperatures. The sheets of ice make it appear as though the falls have stopped; however, the water continues to flow underneath.

The Niagara Falls have only stopped flowing once in history due to ice from Lake Eerie that clogged the mouth of the river. In the 1960s, steel ice booms were installed upriver to prevent that from happening again.

Hard Article:
Development of video calling started in the late 19th century; however, the technology became available to the public in the 1930s.

These early demonstrations were installed in post offices and they were shown at various world expositions. Attempts to use normal telephony networks to transmit video failed mostly due to poor picture quality and the lack of video compression techniques.

The 1955 invention of Television-Phone was hailed ´the telephone of tomorrow´ when it was unveiled by San Diego´s Kay Lab. The device gave a 25-centimeter view of the person who somebody was calling, and it lasted until one of the persons hang up. Very expensive systems continued to evolve throughout the 1980s and 1990s; however, only in the late 20th century with high-speed Internet broadband, video calling became a practical technology for regular use.

Video calling has become an important part of life since, especially for people working from home during 2020 and 2021, and there have been many mishaps and funny moments, too, while using the technology.

A rare Amazonian cactus called Selinecereus, or the moonlight cactus, has bloomed for what botanists believe is the first time in the UK.

The plant is naturally found in Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America, and it has white flowers that only last a single night in most species. It is cultivated only in 13 botanic gardens in the world.

Experts at Cambridge University´s Botanic Garden kept a night watch throughout the week so that they didn´t miss the flowering of the moonlight cactus, an event that usually begins at sunset and it is over by sunrise. The ‘moonflower’ actually bloomed earlier on Saturday afternoon at around 3 pm, and the garden said that it was 28 centimeters long.

The strongly desired flower produces a sweet-smelling scent that turns rancid after just two hours as the plant begins to die.

The house is 180 square meters with a total print time of 48 hours. After the concrete was set up and dry enough, the truss roof system was installed, and then, the interior was finished.

The company is building a near-identical home which is on the market for 299,000 dollars, and the feedback that they get is both positive and negative. According to the company´s director, people are simply unprepared for how construction of homes is going to change. Younger people know 3D printing and it´s a great thing for them. However, some older tradesmen and gentlemen in the field don´t know what 3D printing is and how a house can be made on a 3D printer.

3D printing is a viable way to build because concrete is used which is abundant and used every day all over the world.

The 50-meter-high trash pile occupies 33 hectares, and it receives around 1,000 tons of waste every day. Currently holding close to 30 million cubic meters of rubbish, the site is a major concern to Russia´s environmental agency. It was initially intended as a dump for construction waste; however, it now takes all kinds of rubbish. Russians living near the site say that they can barely breathe due to the noxious fumes.

Russia´s environmental watchdog fined the site´s owner last year, demanding an end to the dumping; however, a court ruled that business could continue despite the damage to the environment. Although protests are regularly held at the site, no one takes responsibility for the dump.

North Macedonia´s fishermen say that the future of Lake Dojran looks brighter with rising water levels and increasing number of fish.

The lake has an area of 43 km2 and it is shared between North Macedonia and Greece. Due to the overuse of the lake´s water for agricultural purposes, this Balkan lake almost disappeared when it lost two thirds of its water in the 1990s, and local fisheries and tourism nearly collapsed. To reverse the decline, the countries took measures to replenish and sustain the lake´s water levels. North Macedonia began pumping water from underground sources, and frequent and heavy rainfalls in the last years also helped restore the lake´s water levels.

Local fishermen say that there are now more fish in the lake; however, scientists say that people still face the consequences of the flora and fauna in the lake. There are sources of pollution that affect the water quality, and the level of water still isn´t properly regulated.

Apple´s possible entry into the global market for cars reemerged recently after going quiet since development first began in 2015.

Apple has kept its plans for an autonomous vehicle in secrecy, given the project´s potential to upend the industry, similar to how Apple´s iPhones have changed the consumer-electronics market. However, Apple likely needs to partner with a car manufacturer because setting up a car plant would cost billions of dollars and take many years. Two Korean automakers, Hyundai and Kia, responded to intense speculation about the potential new product by Apple. Both companies confirmed that they weren´t in talks with Apple to develop an autonomous vehicle.

Sales of electric vehicles are booming in Europe, reaching a record high in 2020. According to forecasts, by 2050, around 65% of all passenger-vehicle kilometers traveled will be electric, and there will be around 800 million electric vehicles out of a total 1.5 billion.

This is what the Swiss Alps looked like on February 6. Skies turned a spectacular shade of orange, not only in Switzerland, but across parts of southwestern Europe.

Sahara dust blanketed parts of southern and central Europe, and it caused a sharp rise in air pollution across the region.

It´s a common yearly phenomenon as sands and dust from the Sahara desert in Africa are swept northwards. However, this year is particularly impressive due to stronger winds and the volume of sand in the air. Skiers at a resort in Anzere, Switzerland, enjoyed the orange snow and the brightly colored skies last weekend. In Lyon, France, people were also mesmerized by the views of the Sahara sand colors taking over the city.

The concentration of Sahara dust didn´t reach levels that scientists consider harmful because the particles are too big to enter the lungs and cause breathing difficulties.

A section of iconic Highway 1 in California, US, collapsed into the ocean on Friday. It was washed out by a winter storm that brought heavy rain and snow.

According to officials, a debris flow overwhelmed drainage infrastructure from the hillside above the highway. It then flowed across the highway and eroded the road, which resulted in a complete loss of a part of the highway. The accident happened about 24 kilometers south of Big Sur, a mountainous stretch of California´s Central Coast.

The California Department of Transportation declared a state of emergency in two counties in a response to winter storms that threatened to cause mud and debris flows, forcing the evacuation of thousands of residents. According to the department, the highway is prone to rock fall and slides, and it is the nature of a road that is built on the edge of a continent where forces of the hillside and the oceans are always at play.
